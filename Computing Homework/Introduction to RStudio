Throughout the semester, we will be learning and working with R and R Studio. Homework assignments are designed to give you practice with the programs in small doses, with weekly repeated practice. Sometimes the assignments will review things we learned in class; sometimes you will be asked to tackle new things on your own. 
Google is your friend. If you do not know/understand how to do something, try googling it! You can also work with a classmate, but make sure that BOTH of you ultimately understand how to do the task at the end. 
**You are encouraged to drop by office hours for our Class Tutor (Toffy) or email her with questions.
